This is a discord bot that I occasionally play with and only use on my personal discord server. This is
run with a .bat file. More commands/functionality will eventually be added when I think of something that 
may be useful. Currently I am thinking of working with the Imgur API for members to upload screenshots
in the context of showing their items in the game Black Desert Online so that guild leaders can double check 
a members gear score.
